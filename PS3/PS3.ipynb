    "In this problem we'll explore an optimization often referred to as **_double buffering_**, which we'll use to speed up the **external merge sort algorithm** we saw in _Lecture 12_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we haven't explicitly modeled it in many of our calculations so far, recall that _sequential IO_ (i.e. involving reading from / writing to consecutive pages) is generally much faster that _random access IO_ (any reading / writing that is not sequential). Additionally, on newer memory technologies like SSD reading data can be faster than writing data (if you want to read more about SSD access patterns look [here](http://codecapsule.com/2014/02/12/coding-for-ssds-part-5-access-patterns-and-system-optimizations/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for example, if we read 4 consecutive pages from file $A$, this should be much faster than reading 1 page from $A$, then 1 page from file $B$, then the next page from $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this problem, we will begin to model this, by assuming that 3/4 sequential _READS_ are \"free\", i.e. the total cost of $4$ sequential reads is $1$ IO. We will also assume that the writes are always twice as expensive as a read. Sequential writes are never free, therefore the cost of $N$ writes is always $2N$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other important notes:\n",
    "* **NO REPACKING:** Consider the external merge sort algorithm using the basic optimizations we present in section 1 of Lecture 12, but do not use the repacking optimization covered in Lecture 12.\n",
    "* **ONE BUFFER PAGE RESERVED FOR OUTPUT:** Assume we use one page for output in a merge, e.g. a $B$-way merge would require $B+1$ buffer pages\n",
    "* **REMEMBER TO ROUND:** Take ceilings (i.e. rounding up to nearest integer values) into account in this problem for full credit!  Note that we have sometimes omitted these (for simplicity) in lecture.\n",
    "* **Consider worst case cost:** In other words, if 2 reads _could happen_ to be sequential, but in general might not be, consider these random IO"

He wants to do this by being more of a sabermetrics guy than a numbers guy. As a first step in doing this he wants to find out which are the colleges each NFL teams prefers drafting players from. We have access to two tables: (i) a table named \"teams\" which contains (team, player) pairs, and (ii) a table named \"colleges\" which contains (player, college) pairs. Being all excited about databases you decide that there is no other way but to join the two tables and get the desired results. However, you have no access to a database. Not even a challenge for you who decide to implement your favorite join algorithm on your own. And of course HASH JOIN is the way to go!!!\n"
